rBiblia is a free program which allows searching, browsing and comparing different Bible translations.

Its minimum requirements are:
– a computer with Windows XP (x86/x64) or newer,
– .NET framework version 3.5/4 installed (checked during the installation process),
– an Internet connection (to download new Bible translations).

As the author, I did my best to make the program work as it was intended to. I do not, however, take any responsibility for any damage resulting from its use.

I will be thankful for any remarks and ideas concerning its operation.
